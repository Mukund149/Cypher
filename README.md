## Cypher - Your Personal Virtual Assistant 🎙️🧠
Cypher is a Python-based virtual assistant that listens, responds, and performs a wide range of tasks to make your digital life easier — built with love, curiosity, and a bit of madness. 🚀

✨ This project was built when I was in 10th grade. It represents the beginning of my journey into tech and coding. It's untouched, raw, and a reminder that passion beats experience. ✨
